Create a TEST_PLAN.md file in your project root that lists out every test you intend to run and what that test is looking for.
TEST_PLAN.md should encompass not just the tests you intend to write for the create and update views, but every test youâ€™ve written thus far. I want to see your thought process.
TEST_PLAN.md will need to be updated as you update your code next week. Keep it current!
