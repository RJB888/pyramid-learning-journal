I'll keep getting at it, and working the things, but in the end, I'm not sure I'll have a good grasp of any particular thing.  More like, just enough 'copy and paste' to get a decent grade.  Its hard to have the time to actually learn what the things are we are doing when we have to just spit out work as fast as possible just to keep up with the pace.  I'm not sure its a method thats conducive to learning....",

Since it seems to follow the same general idea of pyramid, I'm hoping it won't be too hard to wrap my head around.  We will see.

Then we proceeded  to spend 3 hours coding it ourselves, and I feel like we may not have done as good a job as Amazon did.  We have most of the basic functionality working, we just have to tune it so that Alexa doesn't get confused between confirming data and trying to launch a new intent.",

I didn't sit through the code review today, because its even more difficult for things to stay on track when Nick isn't there than when he is.  After the initial code review we went through 'my' code base for the Pyramid project, which was frustrating because even though it would completely crash on my system, when Nick pulled the repo - it effing RAN!! Spending 4+ hours on code that someone else can run with no issues makes one want to throw themselves in front of traffic - at times.  After that fiasco, we went through building an app from scratch with a database.  That helped me understand more how the database connects in with the pyramid.  Though I still don't feel like I have any level of competency.  If you ask ... some people.. that is totally fine and expected.  Well, fine.. I guess I'm doing great then.  If our measure of success is how hard we fail... I'm pretty sure I'm at the top of the class.  I'm definitely bucking for 'most hours put in'",

Felt like the data-structures portion is going better than the networking portion.  Not sure what to make of that.  I'm not too sure what the proper trade off is.  Is it better to really understand the data-structures or is it better to know how to set up servers?  I'm starting to get worried about the project... as I do.... but I suppose that is a good thing.  If I thought it was going to be easy, it probably wouldn't be a good project to do.  Hopefully I'll find some balance in this morass of server information.  I felt the incorporation of sql was pretty straight-forward, but I have to catch up to that point to even implement it..... thus is the life of python.",

I continue to feel like I am behind and unsure of how to implement the code, even though I can walk through it or write bits of it just fine.  Getting the test-first flow down is a bit tricky, especially fighting the urge to write the test to match what the code is doing.  I do see the upshot of writing the test first.  Since you know what your functions are supposed to be doing, you can write the test that would show it is indeed doing that, and then tweak your code until it is passing the tests... and you should be golden.... should be....",
