Felt like the data-structures portion is going better than the networking portion.  Not sure what to make of that.  I'm not too sure what the proper trade off is.  Is it better to really understand the data-structures or is it better to know how to set up servers?  I'm starting to get worried about the project... as I do.... but I suppose that is a good thing.  If I thought it was going to be easy, it probably wouldn't be a good project to do.  Hopefully I'll find some balance in this morass of server information.  I felt the incorporation of sql was pretty straight-forward, but I have to catch up to that point to even implement it..... thus is the life of python.",

Worked on data structures today.. mpre with lists - queues.  Seems like the more we do with the list objects, the easier it is.  Most of the methods can be used in each of the different lists, if you just use the correct ones for the correct structure implementation.  Good stuff.",

I continue to feel like I am behind and unsure of how to implement the code, even though I can walk through it or write bits of it just fine.  Getting the test-first flow down is a bit tricky, especially fighting the urge to write the test to match what the code is doing.  I do see the upshot of writing the test first.  Since you know what your functions are supposed to be doing, you can write the test that would show it is indeed doing that, and then tweak your code until it is passing the tests... and you should be golden.... should be....",
